Here is the email I sent everyone detailing what I'm doing with the network controller

Also, I want to know what you think about having a NetworkController class. It will monitor a port for incoming network activity and route the messages to the right spot. In addition it would be able to establish new connections with other contacts more easily. Here's what it does:

Listen to a port for network activity and if it detects any then read in the first line which will contain a string that looks something like:
msg,invite,Matthew

That message would indicate that it needs to be routed to the messagecontroller. So it would pass the string and socket onto SODApp then go back to listening to the port for more messages. SODApp would have a method that determines what messagecontroller function needs to be called and calls it with the proper arguments. Then the message controller deals with it appropriately.

Our networking would be more flexible that way. I already have the backbone for the NetworkController coded too. All that needs to be finishes in the Send method (which is easy, lol). The send method would be used for sending encoded messages to other clients network controller.
