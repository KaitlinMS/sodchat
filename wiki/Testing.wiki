List of things we need to test

= Introduction =

To make testing easier, I want to compile a list of things we need to test.


= Details =

  * Group Octave with one hub
  * Group Octave with chain-like collaboration setup
  * File transfer
  * File transfer with more than one person
  * File transfer receiving more than one
  * Adding offline contact and then they come online
  * Someone leaving a chained group collab (should create two separate collabs)
  * Hub person leaving group collab
  * Sending/receiving large messages (such as one with no spaces?  or just a lot of text?)
